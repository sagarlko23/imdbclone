# IMDB-clone
This project is a web application that utilizes the power of vanilla JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience. The main feature of the app is its ability to search for movie using the omdb API. The API returns a variety of data related to the searched movie, such as movie title, year, and other important information. The app then displays this information in an easy-to-read format, allowing users to quickly find the movie details they are looking for to watch.
